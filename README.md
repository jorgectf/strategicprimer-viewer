## Strategic Primer Assistive Programs

This repository contains a suite of assistive programs for players and Judges
of the strategy game
[Strategic Primer](https://strategicprimer.wordpress.com).
The flagship application is a map viewer; players may also find the
worker-management app useful. Other programs are primarily designed for use by
the Judge in maintaining the master map.

### Features

The viewer reads and writes a custom XML-based map format that (except for
"seeing the forest among the trees") is also quite human-readable (for those of
a somewhat technical background). Maps contain a number of tiles of various
terrain types, each of which can contain any number of various kinds of
"fixtures," including units, fortresses, animals, orchards, and dragons, among
many others.

### Getting the Program

Old pre-compiled binaries are available from the
[BitBucket downloads
page](https://bitbucket.org/kingjon/strategicprimer-viewer/downloads), and more
up-to-date ones are available from the [GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/kingjon/strategicprimer-viewer/releases). These
include Windows executables, (archives containing) Mac "application"
bundles, and cross-platform "Java archive" (JAR) files.

### Development

The viewer is under active development, as you can see by reading [the monthly
development
reports](https://strategicprimer.wordpress.com/category/development-reports)
(and [older development reports on the the author's main blog](
https://shinecycle.wordpress.com/tag/assistive/)) or examining the commits in
this repository.  Interested developers or users can help by reporting issues,
requesting features, or contributing patches.

Changes to the project are automatically tested using Travis Continuous

### Dependencies and Building from Source

To build the apps from source, a few dependencies need to be installed:

- A working [Ceylon](https://ceylon-lang.org) compiler, version 1.3.3 or later.
- A Java development kit compatible with Java 8
- The "Window menu" implementation by "mickleness." Until [his Pumpernickel
  project](https://github.com/mickleness/pumpernickel) makes a release onto
  Maven, download [the JAR he committed into his
  repository](https://github.com/mickleness/pumpernickel/raw/master/pump-release/com/pump/pump-swing/1.0.00/pump-swing-1.0.00.jar)
  and import it into Ceylon as `com.pump.swing/1.0.00` using `ceylon
  import-jar`.

With those, you should be able to build the project with `ceylon compile` and
run it with `ceylon run strategicprimer.viewer`.

To reproduce my process of building a release, however, and to run the tests
more easily (since simply running `ceylon test` runs into [a bug in the Ceylon
runtime](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon/issues/6986)), you should install the
following additional dependencies:

- [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
- [The JarBundler Ant task](https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler)
- To build any platform-native app, to render the icon into the various sizes
  that the various tools want, you need
  [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) (or, conceivably,
  [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/); we use the `convert`
  command).
- To build the Windows `.exe`, you need
  [Launch4J](https://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/) and the `icotool`
  command provided by [icoutils](http://www.nongnu.org/icoutils/).
- To build the Mac `.app`, you need [the "universal Java application
  stub"](https://github.com/tofi86/universalJavaApplicationStub) and the
  `png2icns` command provided by
  [libicns](https://sourceforge.net/projects/icns/)
- To build the Mac DMG, in addition to what's needed for the `.app`, you need a
  `mkisofs` command; this is typically provided by the
  [`cdrtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdrtools/) package.

(`tar`, `bzip`, and the like should already be installed on any system I can
imagine trying to build a release from.)

Once you have these dependencies installed, use Ant to build the software.
There are several build targets in the build script (which is `build.xml`, the
file Ant looks to by default):

- `clean` removes any compiled code from prior builds.
- `cleanall` calls `clean`, and additionally removes any generated
  documentation HTML files.
- `build` compiles the software, delegating to `ceylon compile`.
- `doc` generates HTML documentation from the source---or will once that Ceylon
  runtime bug I mentioned is fixed
- `test` runs all the tests that are in modules that are known not to cause
  `ceylon test` to crash.
- `jar` packages the entire compiled code, and all runtime dependencies, into a
  JAR.
- `exe` turns that JAR into a Windows-native executable.
- `app` packages the JAR into a Mac OS application (which it additionally
  packages into a tarball, since a `.app` is a directory with its contents
  arranged a particular way, so it can be distributed over the Internet).
- `dmg` packages that `.app` Mac application into a Mac DMG.
- `dist` packages up the source, compiled modules, dependencies, and just about
  everything else (but not the JAR or either of the "native" apps) into a
  tarball.
- `release` is a convenience target: it calls `dmg`, `exe`, and `dist`.

### Running the Program

If you have an EXE or `.app`, it should behave like a standard platform-native
application. If you have a JAR, if file associations are properly set up you
can double-click it, but if you want to run any of the apps other than the map
viewer, the worker-management app, or the exploration GUI, you'll need to call
it from the command line: `java -jar /path/to/viewer-0.4.${version}.jar
subcommand [-options] /path/to/map.xml` .

If you've compiled the apps from source, there's a simpler way: `ceylon run
strategicprimer.viewer subcommand [-options] /path/to/map.xml`. (If one of the
options happens to be one that the Ceylon runtime itself uses, pass `--`
somewhere before that.)
